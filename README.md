## Prerequistes

Please run test_environment.ipynb. It checks the versions of your python and some packages (like pandas, numpy, matplotlib). If the notebook returns all OK, you should be able to run the presentation without issues. If some FAILs are returned, you need to install/update those packages first.

You can recreate the python environment using the youtube_EDA.yml conda environment file by running these two commands in the terminal:

`conda env create -n youtube_EDA -f youtube_EDA.yml`

`conda activate youtube_EDA`

You should be able to run EDA.ipynb now.
