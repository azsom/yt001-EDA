# The BEST way to start EDA - from a data science prof

I will walk you through the five essential steps I take to start exploratory data analysis in any data science project. I’ve been working as a data scientist since 2015 and became an instructor at Brown University in 2021. I have worked on over 20 machine learning projects personally and teach data science to roughly 50 graduate students each year. I understand that starting a new data science project can be overwhelming. Whether you've received little direction from your boss or you're unsure where to begin in the sea of summary statistics and potential figures, it's natural to feel daunted but I’m here to help!

## Prerequistes

Please run test_environment.ipynb. It checks the versions of your python and some packages (like pandas, numpy, matplotlib). If the notebook returns all OK, you should be able to run the presentation without issues. If some FAILs are returned, you need to install/update those packages first.

You can recreate the python environment using the youtube_EDA.yml conda environment file by running these two commands in the terminal:

`conda env create -n youtube_EDA -f youtube_EDA.yml`

`conda activate youtube_EDA`

You should be able to run EDA.ipynb now.
